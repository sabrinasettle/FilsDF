# FDF

A graphical representation of a landscape using a grid or wireframe linked by segments on the x, y, and z axis. The points are translated from a .fdf file, or "fils de fer" and correspond to a point in space.

**Installion if you are into that kinda thing**

Clone the repo.

use the command 'make' to compile the libft library, the minimlx library and create the binary named "fdf".

the usage for the project is ./fdf <map.fdf>.

There is access to maps in my repo in the maps folder so just direct the input argument there.
